          <p class="clearfix">KPK, is one of the four provinces of Pakistan. It is located in the northwestern region of the country, along the Afghanistan–Pakistan border, and the city of Peshawar serves as its capital.

          While it is the third-largest Pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy, it is geographically the smallest.[5] The province is home to 17.9 percent of Pakistan's total population, with the majority of its inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindkowans. Within Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa borders Punjab, Balochistan, the Islamabad Capital Territory, and the Pakistani-administered territories of Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

          <p>The Punjab region is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and North India.[1] The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term "Punjab" has changed over time. In the 16th century Mughal Empire it referred to a relatively smaller area between the Indus and the Sutlej rivers.[2] In British India, until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province encompassed the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi and the Pakistani regions of Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory. It bordered the Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa regions to the west, Kashmir to the north, the Hindi Belt to the east, and Rajasthan and Sindh to the south.</p>
